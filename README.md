# Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to classify text messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" (not spam) using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new messages based on the learned features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from a collection of SMS messages. It includes two labels:
- **Spam**: Unwanted messages often containing promotions or advertisements.
- **Ham**: Legitimate messages that are not spam.
